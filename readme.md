This repository contains a simple multiplayer plugin for VR, that lets you mirror what is happing on the VR headsets PC to multiple clients. 

It also contains an edited version of the URoboVision plugin. Some small changes were needed for it to work in multiplayer. These changes however make it depend on many other plugins, so it should only be used if multiplayer is needed.
